The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

### Rules
- A live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- A live cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- A live cell with more than tree neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- A dead cell with exactly three neighbours is reborn and becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
